        <h2>Thoughts That Troubled My Mind</h1>
        <pre class="essay">
            When I was 5, my biggest fear was the dark. The thought of not being aware of what was present with me
            disturbed me so much, I could not even bear the 10 meter journey from the couch to my bedroom. But as I grew
            older, I got to draw reassurance from my memory that home was a safe place. So the dark became a friend, as
            long it was a familiar environment.

            Then one day, we lost my grandmother, whom I loved so much. This brought the concept of death right out of
            the action movies into my life. The label “biggest fear” shifted to death as I realized that every human
            close to me was at risk of death anytime, anywhere. This new fear was the beginning of a string of questions
            that dictated what made my life miserable, and what made it worth living.

            Right after becoming a teen, the world spun faster and faster by the year. As I learnt new information, I
            overwhelmingly wanted to find something to cling onto. Some sort of meaning in the midst of the never ending
            shift in perspective I was undergoing on a daily basis.

            I tried to squeeze my days with as much laughter, as much happiness, as much of “goodness” as I could
            possibly fit into a 24 hour gift. I wanted to be the best at anything I could get my hands on. I want to
            know as much as I could cram into my head. Don’t get me wrong, this was pretty good stuff. But what was
            killing me was the reason I was doing it.

            See, even without consciously thinking about it, I felt a need to do something. To become someone. To be
            important in some sort of way. Because whenever I looked at everyone else, I felt small. Despite any
            accomplishment, despite any good character I might have had built; It always felt like my train of thought
            was all about zeroing into what wasn’t going right with me. Which leads to more pushing, more pushing
            brought more failure and the circle was circling.

            That is when writing came in. At first writing was another attempt to create something and see if it makes
            me happy. But this time, I created something that told me more about myself than anyone else ever did. I
            would write a song and it would feel like opening a new room into my mind that I didn’t know existed. Every
            poem, every verse was like taking my thoughts and placing them on a timeline for me to retrace.

            With such a powerful mirror, I was prone to start journaling. At 18, I spent my time thinking and writing
            about literally everything that came to my mind. I was thinking, and also thinking about thinking. So one
            day I wake up and I decide to ask myself the question for a millionth time.

            “What are you afraid of?”
            “Dying.”

            “You need to give a better answer than that”
            “Dying before I lived my life”

            “Aren’t you almost 19 years old, though? You could be at 95% of your life as far as we know.”
            “Yes, but there’s so much shit we ain’t done yet!”

            “Like what?”
            “Like get fucking rich, having sex, performing in front of thousands of people, creating some masterpieces…
            Actual living shit! ”

            “I see. What if you died in the morrow? Would that mean your life never started?”

            It’s funny I couldn’t answer my own question. But this planted a seed reflection that brings me to the
            thoughts I was having before beginning to write this essay. What if I aim at long term goals, but they’re so
            far away that I can’t reach them anytime soon. What if I died before I got those accolades that I have been
            chasing. But I also do not want to play the short term game. I’ve tried giving into the ‘happiness’ of the
            moment. And that didn’t work out as well as I imagined. In the movies or instagram we see this ‘a day in the
            life’ of someone, but as far as I know, all my friend’s life is a rollercoaster of emotions. It is messy and
            chaotic. And it troubles me because I refuse to believe this is all we have. All we get is a moment of
            confusion, hopes, futile moments and regrets.

            With this in mind, I tend to look back at my two decades sample of life to find which moments bring me the
            most joy. Moments with the people I love, the moments I was deeply engaged with activities I enjoy, moments
            I satisfied my curiosity or created something that I found splending… In those times, it felt like God
            granted me the ability to stop time and accelerate it at the same time. Just like last Friday at Aunt
            Grace’s on my birthday; Just like right now that I am writing this piece, the concept of time seems alien to
            me. I just exist.
            I used to wish life came with a manual (and I still do), but sitting here and seeing myself get closer to
            answering my own troubling question makes me realize that I might be the manual that I always yearned for.
            Despite the baggage from the past, and the uncertainty of the future; I can find it deep down in me to
            choose to love something, or someone, until it makes life worth living. And to be honest there’s so much to
            love:the sun, the people, the food, the smells, the art, the sciences, the books, the development, the kids,
            myself and subsequently life itself. That gift we didn’t ask for.

            The thought that I expressed enough love one day at a time to all the things and people worth my love makes
            the thought of dying a little more tolerable.
