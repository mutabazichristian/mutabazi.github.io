            <h2>Hi</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Mutabazi. And this is a brief bio to tell you who I am. I was born in 2003, we lived somewhere in Gicumbi... But that’s just mere facts. That’s not exactly me. I’m a software engineering student, I do hip hop music and occasionally write. But, again.. I can decide to change that any minute and stop doing my bachelors.<br><br>
            
            Well I guess I’m the person sitting in front of a laptop. Around 1.80 meters tall, dark skin and overweight... But that’s just the shell of a body that I get to live in. If I lost a leg, I'd still be me. Same thing with my arms and legs. I guess my brain is what I'm left with so, I’ll describe that.<br><br>
            
            Well, I have a bunch of stuff that I know: Some Math, Physics and a lot of Kendrick Lamar verses. But I can still forget those. There’s a chance that I won’t know any of that when/if I get old and weary.<br><br>
            
            What am I left with? This sort of conscious blob of whatever that brings to my attention random words and tells fingers to hit buttons and make figures appear on a screen. I do not know what that is. I only know that _it is._ I spend a lot of time playing with the fact of _being_ with no avail. So I’ll stop here. All I can tell you is that if you’re reading this: _I was._<br><br>
            
            As you read this, I’m sort of dictating what you are aware of. The same weird sounds playing in your head were arranged by my blob for your own blob to play for you (like a song, lol). There it is. My blob saying “Hello” to yours. I guess we’re friends now.<br><br>
            
            Yours sincerely,<br><br>
